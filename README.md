# mini-project-I

Welcome to your first **Mini Project**. This repo contains instructions what to do during the project. Enjoy!! 

## Transport of London

During this mini-project, we will work with the API from [Transport of London](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). The main goal of this project is to practice different HTTP requests and extracting values from complex lists and nested dictionaries.

> #### Instruction
> Register for the API service to obtain an **Application ID** and **Key**. We should append these values as parameters `app_id` and `app_key` into each URL when sending the request.

`?app_id={app_id}&app_key={app_key}` should be appended to every URL in all HTTP requests. However, this API works **without** the `app_id` and `app_key` in case we can't register for some reason.

> #### Instruction
> Once you have your credentials ready, go to the file `mini-project-I.ipynb` and follow the instruction in there.





## Presentation

There is dedicated time tomorrow to show the results to mentors and our peers. We encourage you to spend some time at the end of today to start think about that and to:

- polish your code
- think about how do you want to show the results (share screen with notebook, slides...)
